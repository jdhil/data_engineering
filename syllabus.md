# Syllabus

## Overview

This 6-week program provides hands-on introduction to Apache Hadoop and Spark programming using Python and cloud computing. The key components that will be covered in the course include Hadoop Distributed File Systems, MapReduce using MRJob, Apache Hive, Pig, as well as Spark. Tools and platforms that will be used include Docker, Amazon Web services and Databricks. In the first half of the program, students need to pull a pre-built Docker image and run most of the exercises locally using docker containers. In the second half, students need to access to their AWS and Databricks accounts to run cloud computing exercises. Students will need to bring their laptops to class. Detailed instructions will be provided ahead of time on how to pull and run a docker image, how to connect to AWS/Databricks, etc.
